### Description
This is an incomplete solution to the user management system. The app uses RESTAPI to perform CRUD commands, employing a specified worker database model. It includes a referral system where a worker can refer others into the system.

### How to Start the App
1. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and your MongoDB server is running.
2. Navigate into the `User_Management_system` folder.
3. Install all dependencies using:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. If your database server is running, start the application with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The port will be displayed in the command line console.

### Notes
- The app does not use any frontend framework, relying instead on pure HTML code.
- All dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.
- The app will create a key worker with an ID in the database first, known as the super worker. It will not create a new worker entry unless a referral ID is provided.

### Credits
Parts of the code were generated by ChatGPT, with the remaining written by the author. The author hopes to learn more to create a more robust application. RESTAPI was used to solve this exercise.
